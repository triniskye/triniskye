Hi, Iâ€™m @triniskye ðŸ‘‹ 
My programming experience includes JavaScript, Ruby, and SQL.
I am currently learning Ruby on Rails, Python, and C#.
Learning new programming languages and mastering them is my passion, and I am currently studying Software Engineering with 
Academy XI and am completing a Certificate III in Information Technology, specialising in Programming and Web Development through Envirotech. 

Once I finish my studies I hope to find a job as a Software Developer, or anything that involves programming really :)
